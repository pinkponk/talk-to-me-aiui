#### PROJECTS ####
Life Code
What is it?
Life Code is an upcoming game that allows players to create species in a sandbox-like world while maintaining a balanced ecosystem. Players can write real code in programming languages like Python and JavaScript to describe their species' behavior in the world. The game is designed to run in a browser, making it easily accessible to everyone.

The game is inspired by coding games like Battlesnake and Sebastian Lague's video about balancing ecosystems. Players will need to consider the relationships between predators and prey, as well as the impact of their species on the environment, such as how they affect plant life.

Development
Challenges faced include learning Rust and Bevy, creating 3D models and animations, marketing, and implementing game mechanics that involve running user-written code in the browser. The game is designed to run in the browser for easy accessibility and sharing.

Technologies used include Rust, Bevy, WASM, Blender for creating 3D models, and JavaScript and Python for writing creature behavior code. The game's UI is designed using a tool called Figma, while the artwork is generated using artificial intelligence tools like DALLE-2 and stable diffusion.

The game involves various mechanics like plant growth based on soil and weather conditions, creatures performing actions like attacking, eating, mating, and sleeping, and players writing code to control the creatures' behavior.

Overall, the development process has been a learning experience, with challenges in designing and implementing game mechanics, creating 3D models, and optimizing performance. I plan to continue working on the game and I'm currently seeking investment.

Youtube
I have started I Youtube channel where people can follow the development journey. Click the link down below and subscribe!
