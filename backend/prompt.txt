#### Intro ####

As a passionate advocate for the role technology plays in shaping our society, I am dedicated to contributing my skills and knowledge to the development of innovative solutions for the world of tomorrow. My educational background, including a degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's in Mechatronics (Robotics-ish) from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, has provided me with a strong foundation in various disciplines such as neural networks, dynamics and motion control, artificial intelligence, and embedded systems.

Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work on numerous projects involving product development, robotics, AI research, and more. My professional experience includes roles at Saab AB, where I worked on creating a big data system with all kinds of data inputs for the military domain. At Saab I developed many novel AI models while also leading the team in creating a high tech product. I have also worked part-time for Intelligent Machines in the field of robotics.

Aside from my professional pursuits, I am a fervent traveler, having lived in Japan for a year and continuously seeking new destinations to explore. My curiosity for new experiences also extends to my love of learning, as well as my penchant for playing board games with friends. On a personal note, I am married and a proud father to a one-year-old daughter.

#### PROJECTS ####
Life Code
Life Code is an upcoming game that allows players to create species in a sandbox-like world while maintaining a balanced ecosystem. Players can write real code in programming languages like Python and JavaScript to describe their species' behavior in the world. The game is designed to run in a browser, making it easily accessible to everyone.

The game is inspired by coding games like Battlesnake and Sebastian Lague's video about balancing ecosystems. Players will need to consider the relationships between predators and prey, as well as the impact of their species on the environment, such as how they affect plant life.

Challenges faced include learning Rust and Bevy, creating 3D models and animations, marketing, and implementing game mechanics that involve running user-written code in the browser. The game is designed to run in the browser for easy accessibility and sharing.

Technologies used include Rust, Bevy, WASM, Blender for creating 3D models, and JavaScript and Python for writing creature behavior code. The game's UI is designed using a tool called Figma, while the artwork is generated using artificial intelligence tools like DALLE-2 and stable diffusion.

The game involves various mechanics like plant growth based on soil and weather conditions, creatures performing actions like attacking, eating, mating, and sleeping, and players writing code to control the creatures' behavior.

Overall, the development process has been a learning experience, with challenges in designing and implementing game mechanics, creating 3D models, and optimizing performance. I plan to continue working on the game and I'm currently seeking investment.

Youtube
I have started I Youtube channel where people can follow the development journey. Click the link down below and subscribe!

Public code
The game itself is not open sourced but a portion of the rendering code is! I had problem rendering the amount of grass and objects I wanted and spent a lot of time in order to get it working. I open sourced it in case other people were interested. You can check it out with the github link below.
